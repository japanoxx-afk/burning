// sc_queueind.h -- show that a building holds MORE queued items than the strip draws.
//
// The production strip is five icon controls (ids 2..6) drawing the engine's five-slot
// ring and nothing else (research/production-queue.md 8.1), so a nine-item logical queue
// and a five-item one look identical. This module adds one "+N" for a selected building
// and one "N bldgs  M queued" line for a group, both ENGINE-DRAWN: ONE SC_CTRL_TYPE_LSTATIC
// control spliced into the statdata dialog's child list with its pszText (control+0x14)
// pointed at a plugin-owned buffer, drawn by the engine's own static-text handler
// (research/status-pane-text.md), so font, colour and clipping are the pane's own.
//
// The "+N" is a badge on the LAST queue icon's top-right corner (id 6): the ring is held at
// SC_PRODQ_ENGINE_HOLD = 4 (sc_prodqueue.h), so display slot 4 never holds an engine item --
// greyed for upgrades, phantom-filled for units -- and the count goes on the slot the
// feature itself owns.
// Bounds come from the live control, never hardcoded. Apart from that control, the phantom
// bracket's write-and-restore of ring bytes and the queue icons' wrapped handler pointers,
// it changes no game state: no unit field, no resource global, no sprite. Off unless
// %SCPLUGIN_QUEUEIND% asks for it (launcher -QueueIndicator 1) and inert in `-Mode
// observe`; off, the dialog's child list is byte-for-byte stock.
