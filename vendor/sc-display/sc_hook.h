// sc_hook.h -- minimal x86 inline-detour engine.
//
// This is the first code in this project that WRITES to the running game, so the
// design is deliberately narrow and paranoid:
//
//  * No length disassembler. The caller supplies `patchLen` -- the exact number of
//    whole instruction bytes to relocate -- as a constant taken from a disassembly
//    of THIS binary (tools/ghidra/scripts/HookProbe.java prints it, and also prints
//    whether any instruction in that window is PC-relative and therefore NOT
//    relocatable). Guessing an instruction length inside a foreign process is the
//    fastest way to corrupt it; a table checked against the binary is not a guess.
//
//  * Prologue signature check. The caller also supplies the bytes it expects to
//    find. Install REFUSES if memory does not match. A wrong address, a different
//    build, or an already-hooked target therefore fails loudly at install time
//    instead of executing spliced garbage.
//
//  * Allocate and re-protect BEFORE suspending threads. VirtualAlloc/VirtualProtect
//    take process-wide locks; taking one while another thread is suspended holding
//    it would deadlock the game. Only the memcpy happens under suspension.
//
//  * Every hook is removable, and RemoveAll runs on detach.
