// sc_hudrow.h -- page the bottom-HUD wireframe row through the whole shadow
// selection, so the units the fan-out commands past the engine's 12-cap reach the
// row too. research/hud-selection-row.md maps that row end to end.
//
// The row is 12 dialog controls (ids 0x21..0x2C) in the rez\statdata.bin dialog.
// Each button displays and clicks WHATEVER CUnit* sits in its 8-byte statUser
// record -- no engine draw or click path asks whether that unit is engine-selected
// (hud-selection-row.md 6), so filling those records from one PAGE of the shadow
// list is enough. At <= 12 units the stock path runs stock, untouched: the dialog
// is pixel-stock, and the wrap and indicator splice below are applied lazily on
// the first overflow display and undone on the way back.
//
// Detour the status-area dispatcher 0x00458120, not the multi-select act/cond
// pair: the engine's single-unit branch never calls that act, so only the
// dispatcher can restore stock when a shadow click drops the selection to one unit.
