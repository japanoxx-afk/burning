// sc_prodqueue.h -- more than five items in a building's production queue.
// The engine's queue is a five-slot ring in the CUnit (u16[5] at +0x98, head byte at
// +0xA4); the 5 is baked into unrolled/modulo-5 arithmetic in six functions plus the
// building AI's mirror arrays, so it cannot be widened, relocated or re-strided in place
// and this plugin never tries (research/production-queue.md 5). It keeps a per-building
// OVERFLOW list instead and holds the engine's ring one slot BELOW its cap
// (SC_PRODQ_ENGINE_HOLD) by taking the newest item back out after every accept. The ring
// still holds real types in player order, so the status-area icons stay truthful, just
// fewer than the logical queue (research/production-queue.md 7).
//
// THE RESOURCE RULE: the engine pays for every item exactly once, in its own
// addToBuildQueue (0x00467250), which also checks affordability; moving an item out of the
// ring and back is a bare `buildQueue[slot] = type` store touching no resource global. The
// plugin's only resource writes are refunds of held items that are lost (cancel, building
// dying, plugin unload), out of the cost tables the engine's own refund reads.
