"""Generate the widescreen patch table for src/sc_screen.cpp.

Task 034. `research/renderer-viewport.md` establishes that the playfield's size
is not stored anywhere -- it is an immediate in every function that clips to it.
Widening the screen therefore means rewriting a few dozen instruction operands
in the running process, and every one of them has to be found, sized and proved
to be the instruction the map says it is.

Hand-maintaining that as a C array of magic bytes would be unreviewable and
would rot the first time somebody mistyped a nibble. So this script owns it:

  * it reads the SAME StarCraft.exe the plugin will patch (default: the
    disposable working copy), maps VA -> file offset through the PE section
    table, and DISASSEMBLES each declared site;
  * for an immediate patch it LOCATES the old value inside the instruction's
    own bytes rather than trusting a hand-written offset, and refuses if the
    encoding is not exactly one unambiguous field of the declared width;
  * for a code patch it disassembles the replacement and prints it beside the
    original, so a reviewer reads two instruction listings instead of two hex
    strings;
  * it emits `sc_screen_patches_<W>x<H>.h` (what the plugin applies; one file per
    geometry preset, listed in sc_screen_presets.h) and, for the default preset,
    `research/data/renderer-widescreen-patches.tsv` (what a human reads).

The plugin re-verifies every `expect` blob at runtime before writing anything,
exactly like the detour engine does (`sc_hook.cpp`), so a table generated
against a different build cannot silently patch the wrong bytes.

Nothing here reads or writes game DATA -- it reads code bytes out of the
executable and emits addresses and encodings. No game content is reproduced.

Usage:
  python tools/renderer_patch_sites.py [--exe PATH] [--width 1280] [--height 880]
                                       [--check]     # verify only, write nothing

    # The window procedure clamps every mouse coordinate to the STOCK screen
    # before building an input event or writing the cursor globals
    # (research/renderer-viewport.md 8, last row of the 640x480 table), so an x
    # past 639 -- real or posted -- becomes 639 and the widened columns are
    # unreachable by any click. Each clamp is a PAIR: a `cmp .., 640` that
    # decides and a `mov .., 639` that replaces; patching the 639 alone turns
    # "click at 700" into a click at the new right edge. X pairs widen to the new
    # screen; their Y twins are in the SCREEN-height block below. Moving the CONSOLE
    # sideways into the widened region is unshipped: relocating the console dialogs'
    # bounds moves their hit-test but NOT their on-screen pixels
    # (renderer-viewport.md 18).
